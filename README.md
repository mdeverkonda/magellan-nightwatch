# magellan-nightwatch

The [NightwatchJS](http://nightwatchjs.org/) adapter for [Magellan](https://github.com/TestArmada/magellan)

## IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTICE

In **magellan-nightwatch@4.0.0** we've removed Chromedriver, Phantomjs and Selenium-server as these are not required while running your test on Saucelabs. However, they are still necessary if you want to run test locally. To use them, you will have to 

1. Copy/cat following code to `package.json` of your test repo.

  ```
  "dependencies": {
    "selenium-server": "2.49.1",
    "chromedriver": "2.16.0",
    "phantomjs": "^1.9.19"
  }
  ```
2. Run `npm install` again. Dependencies will be installed in `${REPO_ROOT}/node_modules`.
3. Make sure your `nightwatch.json` file has the following change
  ```
  "selenium": {
    "start_process": true,
    "server_path": "./node_modules/selenium-server/lib/runner/selenium-server-standalone-2.49.1.jar",
    "log_path": "reports",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 12001,
    "cli_args": {
      "webdriver.ie.driver": "",
      "webdriver.chrome.driver": "./node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver"
    }
  }
  ```
  
  if you're using Phantomjs
  ```
  "test_settings":{
    "phantomjs": {
      "desiredCapabilities": {
        "browserName": "phantomjs",
        "javascriptEnabled": true,
        "acceptSslCerts": true,
        "phantomjs.binary.path": "./node_modules/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs"
      }
    }
  }
  ```


## Running Tests

For instructions on how to run tests, please see the `magellan` documentation at: https://github.com/TestArmada/magellan

## Writing Tests

Tests are structured as simple modules with a single exported object containing keyed functions. The functions are executed in the order in which they appear in the object source. Each function represents a step in the test, and its key in the test object should represent the name of the step. Each step function gets a `client` as an argument which represents a browser. For more information on writing tests, see the [Nightwatch.js documentation](http://nightwatchjs.org).

```javascript
  var MagellanTest = require("testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/lib/base-test-class");

  module.exports = new MyTest({
    "Load homepage": function (client) {
      client
        .url("http://localhost/");
    },

    "Verify header is visible": function (client) {
      client
        .getEl("#header");
    }

    "Reveal help modal": function (client)
      client
        .clickAutomationEl("show-help")
        .getEl("#help-modal")
        .assert.elContainsText("#help-modal", "This is the help modal");
    }
  });
```

## Command Vocabulary

`magellan-nightwatch` is a wrapper around [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org), but is constrained to a limited subset of Nightwatch vocabulary to promote reliability.

### Enhanced Command List

If you're familiar with Nightwatch or are looking to translate Nightwatch examples into `magellan-nightwatch`, refer to the table below for equivalent enhanced (i.e. more reliable) versions of Nightwatch commands:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Nightwatch Command / Assertion</td>
    <td>`magellan-nightwatch` Equivalent</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click("[data-automation-id="mybutton"])</td>
    <td>clickAutomationEl("mybutton")</td>
    <td>Needs "data-automation-id" attribute in the clickable HTML element's DOM for this command to work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>click(selector)</td>
    <td>clickEl(selector)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>waitForElementPresent or waitForElementVisible</td>
    <td>getEl(selector)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>moveToElement</td>
    <td>moveToEl(selector, xoffset, yoffset)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setValue(selector, value)</td>
    <td>setElValue(selector, value)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getValue(selector)</td>
    <td>getElValue(selector, callback)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>elements(using, value, callback)</td>
    <td>getEls(selector, callback)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(no nightwatch equivalent)</td>
    <td>scrollToEl(selector)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(no nightwatch equivalent)</td>
    <td>setMaskedElValue(selector, value, [fieldLength])</td>
    <td>Set a value on a field that's using a mask (eg: MM/DD/YYYY or (555) 123-4567) with caret control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>waitForElementNotPresent(selector)</td>
    <td>waitForElNotPresent(selector)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>waitForElementNotPresent(selector)</td>
    <td>waitForElNotPresent(selector)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>getPerformance(url)</td>
    <td>Retrieves basic performance metrics using Navigation API (http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>assert.containsText(selector, text)</td>
    <td>assert.elContainsText(selector, regex or text)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(no nightwatch equivalent)</td>
    <td>assert.elNotContainsText(selector, text)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(no nightwatch equivalent)</td>
    <td>assert.selectorHasLength(selector, expectedLength)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>(no nightwatch equivalent)</td>
    <td>assert.elLengthGreaterThan(selector, selectUsing, lengthToCompare)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Custom selector tokens

All `magellan-nightwatch` selector paths can refer to a `{token}` which your application can implement a replacement value.
The implementation is set as a static value on the `BaseTestClass` as `selectorToken`.  For example, to replace `{foo}`
with `[data-automation-id="foo"]` you would use

```
require('testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/lib/base-test-class').selectorToken = function (value) {
  return '[data-selector-id="' + value + '"]';
}
```

#### Custom Commands Examples

The commands included with `magellan-nightwatch` are safer, more reliable and "thrash-resistent" versions of Nightwatch commands. Note that `clickEl()`, `clickAutomationEl()`, and `setElValue()` are safe to call without first waiting for their selector to appear because they execute `getEl()` as part of their internals. Consider the following snippet:

```javascript
  client
    .getEl("#submit_order")
    .clickEl("#submit_order")
```

The above snippet can be shortened to the following form (and will execute faster):

```javascript
  client
    .clickEl("#submit_order")
```

Our custom commands try be as readable and flexible as possible. For example, rather than just accepting text inside the `el(Not?)ContainsText commands, you can also include a [regular expression](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to match text in a much more flexible way

```javascript
  client
    .elContainsText("#submit_order", "Price \d+\.\d\d")
```

This would match "Price" followed by one more more digits, a decimal, then two more digits.
You can use [regexper](http://regexper.com/#Price%20%5Cd%2B%5C.%5Cd%5Cd) to help visualize and debug regular expressions


### As-is Supported Nightwatch Vocabulary

All Nightwatch commands and assertions are supported out of the box.

#### Supported Nightwatch Commands

* Please refer to [Nightwatch Commands API](http://nightwatchjs.org/api#commands) for a list of supported Nightwatch commands

#### Supported Nightwatch Assertions

* Please refer to [Nightwatch Assertions API](http://nightwatchjs.org/api#assertions) for a list of supported Nightwatch assertions

#### Supported Node Assertions

* `fail`
* `equal`
* `notEqual`
* `deepEqual`
* `notDeepEqual`
* `strictEqual`
* `notStrictEqual`
* `throws`
* `doesNotThrow`
* `ifError`

#### Custom Commands

`magellan-nightwatch` supports the development of custom commands to allow the re-use of common parts of tests. If you're using the same snippets of code to fill out a form that appears in many tests, or have a common way to sign into your application, etc, then custom commands are for you. Please see the [Nightwatch.js documentation](http://nightwatchjs.org) for more on commands.

#### Migrating Nightwatch Configuration

To migrate an existing vanilla `nightwatch.json` configuration to `magellan-nightwatch`, update the following 

Add Magellan's custom commands to your `custom_commands_path`:

```
  "custom_commands_path": [
    "./node_modules/testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/lib/commands",
```

Add Magellan's custom assertions to your `custom_assertions_path`:

```
  "custom_assertions_path": [
    "./node_modules/testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/lib/assertions",
```

Ensure Selenium server/driver paths are correct:

```
  "selenium": {
    "start_process": true,
    "server_path": "./node_modules/testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/node_modules/selenium-server/lib/runner/selenium-server-standalone-2.49.0.jar",
    "log_path": "reports",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 4444,
    "cli_args": {
      "webdriver.chrome.driver": "./node_modules/testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver",
      "webdriver.ie.driver": ""
    }
  },
```

**Note: pay special attention to the version number for the selenium server above, currently at version `2.49.0`***

Set up `phantomjs` path:

```
  "phantomjs" : {
    "desiredCapabilities" : {
      "browserName" : "phantomjs",
      "javascriptEnabled" : true,
      "acceptSslCerts" : true,
      "phantomjs.binary.path" : "./node_modules/testarmada-magellan-nightwatch/node_modules/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs"
```
